# Flashcards-Android-App

I remade https://github.com/Decretum/Flashcards into a simple android app specifically for the USCIS Citizenship test. It only has the 35 questions I personally think are hard, and they're for someone living California (since some of the questions ask things like "who is your US representative".

If you want to repurpose this project for your own use, simply change the list of strings in app/src/main/java/com/example/flashcards/MainActivity.java (I think I called it rawData or something).
